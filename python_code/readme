the code solves the internal wave in a 2D front which is undergoing strain-induced frontogenesis.
The frontogenesis formulation is based on Hoskins and Brethreton (1972).

min_freq belongs to the min frequency IW (commonly known as near-inertial wave) interacting with front
high_freq belong to high frequency IW (here we consider wave frequency = 1.5*f, f = Coriolis freqeuncy)

The code uses the freely available Dedalus (https://github.com/DedalusProject) framwork to solve the governing PDE.
Note that Dedalus only solves the wave part while the frontal solution is based on Hoskins and Brethreton which is
laregly solved by the hb72.pyx.

### how to run the code
First we need to compile hb72.pyx which is written in cython (python wrapped with C), 
to compile please use the below the command line
"python setup.py build_ext --inplace"

Next, use usual command line to run the pyhton code
"python hb72_niw.py > output.log&"

the flow data will be written in a folder "flow", and wave data will be writtn in "wave" folder.

To plot the data, we need to merge the files in the folder, which can be achieved by 
"python merge.py flow/ --cleanup"
and
"python merge.py wave/ --cleanup"
